2. Report of Test 2

Implement an SVM classifier using the following kernel functions:

    (a) 3rd order polynomial function (C = 1)

    (b) 10th order polynomial function (C = 1)

    (c) RBF with Gamma = 2-5 (C = 1)

The original dataset is divided into two parts: 80% for training data and 20%for testing data.

Output three performance evaluators including precision, recall, and F1-score for each classifier.


3. Report of Test 3

Implement a spectral clustering algorithm for k = 2 to predict the survivals on the Titanic problem using data from https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/data?select=train.csv

Output:

    (1) The smallest nonzero eigenvalue and the corresponding eigenvector.
    (2) The 2-class clustering result.


4. Term Project: Assumptions in regression analysis

Listing below are five important assumptions in regression analysis:

    (1) a linear and additive relationship between dependent (response) variable and independent (predictor) variable(s);
    (2) no correlation between the residual (error) terms;
    (3) the independent variables should not be correlated;
    (4) the error terms must have constant variance; and
    (5) the error terms must be normally distributed.

Implement a program to check whether the above assumptions are satisfied or not for a regression model.
